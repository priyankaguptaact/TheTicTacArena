# TheTicTacArena
Welcome to TheTicTacArena! 
This project marks a significant milestone in my learning journey as it is my first project after acquiring DOM manipulation skills.Developing this project allowed me to apply and reinforce my understanding of various web technologies. Using HTML, I structured the game elements, while CSS was employed to style the game and ensure a visually appealing and responsive design. JavaScript played a crucial role in bringing interactivity to the game, enabling DOM manipulation and handling game logic.
